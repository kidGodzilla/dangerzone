        <p>I'm a long time Developer, IT Professional, Designer, and well-rounded nerd.</p>

        <p>I've enjoyed working in all aspects of web development and design, for startups, government clients, small businesses, fortune 500 companies, as well as my own ventures.</p>

        <p>Having traveled to hundreds of world cities in 43 countries, I find nothing more fascinating than the unique peoples, cultures, and experiences which comprise the planet we live on, and nothing more rewarding than the opportunity to learn from unique and interesting individuals.</p>
